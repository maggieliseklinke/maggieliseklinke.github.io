                <h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
                <p>This site definitely meet the needs while being on mobile!
                    <br> 1. Their demographics are college age students, their income is going to be on a student's budget, especially those poor enough not to have a car. The Education is those in college, and lastly, it is specifically for those college students in Rexburg.
                    <br> 2. The site met the needs of the visitor by showing all of the shuttle times for the stops around Rexburg, along with showing a GPS tracker of where the bus currently is!
                    <br> 3. The content was organized into three main sections. The section in the middle was for the map and the GPS tracker. The section on the left was a drop down menu showing all of the stop times and when the shuttle was going to a specific stop next. The section on the right was another menu and was dedicated for trouble shooting and contact information.
                    <br> 4. The site made the mobile experience enjoyable by simply making it easy to use. It was easy to see where exactly the bus was, and easy to click the left menu and see the exact time when it would come to your stop.
                    <br> 5. I do think it facilitated to people in the mobile environment. I think this because it was very easy to use. Like I explained in other examples, it was easy to see the important information that you went to the site for, and was easy to see when the future stops were going to be.

                <h2>Site Contrast</h2>
                <p>
                    1. The worst site I visited was <a href="http://ilearn.byui.edu"> iLearn </a> (I realized I don't really visit non-school websites)
                    <br>
                    <br> 2. The sad thing is, iLearn should know that their demographic is students! When I went to iLearn all I could see was the future due dates, it wasn't nearly as user friendly as the desktop site. To complete any quizzes, you have to go to the desktop site. Whereas the Rexburg Shuttle Site knew that they needed simplicity, and all of the features on their desktop site, needed to be on their mobile site as well.
                    <br>
                    <br> 3. The Rexburg Shuttle site knew that their users needed to see where the shuttle was, and when the shuttle would be at certain stops. iLearn knows that students need to do homework, but their mobile site doesn't allow them to do homework! What happens when their laptop breaks and they don't have the time nor the means to go to campus and use one of those computers? It's really hard to navigate the desktop site on the mobile format.
                    <br>
                    <br> 4. The Rexburg Shuttle site organized them into three main areas of their webiste. Two menus on each side that you are able to toggle. One with the shuttle times, and the other with contact information. iLearn has one main site area, and it just has calendar information, and at the bottom has access to the desktop site.
                    <br>
                    <br> 5. Again, the Rexburg Shuttle Site is basically the same as their desktop site, but it is integrated, better as to that there are three different screens that you can view to get the information. The iLearn site is horrible, because you can only view the calendar and the due dates. They force you to use the desktop site if you want to do anything like quizzes, and even then you ahve to zoon way in to make sure you don't click the wrong thing.
